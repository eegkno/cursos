After waiting for what seemed like an eternity for Android Jelly Bean phones to ship, 
I'm glad to see that a flood of handsets with the coveted software has burst onto the mobile scene. 
Some of these devices, such as the HTC Droid DNA and LG Nexus 4, rolled straight off the assembly 
line boasting Google's most modern OS. Older phones, like the Samsung Galaxy S3 and Motorola 
Droid Razr HD Maxx, just received this significant upgrade.
